As consumers increasingly prioritize sustainable and eco-friendly materials, solid cotton has gained traction due to its organic properties and biodegradability. The market size for solid cotton was valued at approximately <strong>$12 billion</strong> in 2023 and is projected to experience a robust growth trajectory in the coming years.</p> <p>Forecasts indicate that the solid cotton market is expected to reach <strong>$15 billion</strong> by 2024 and could grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about <strong>7.5%</strong> from 2024 to 2032.
